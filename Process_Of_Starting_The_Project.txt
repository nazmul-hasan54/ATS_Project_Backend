Step 1. Restore the database backup file

Step 2. Please open the .NET project and run the application

Step 3. After completing restore backup and running the application, open the angular app (in this project
it's called Frontend) and run the application

Step 4. In this project, you will have two menus named as Home and Blog. In Blog page, if you click any blog
post, it will take you details page of specific blog page. 

This is dynamic. If you click another one, it will also take you dynamically that post details page. At the end
of evry details page article, you'will have to see a button named as EditBlog. 

If you click on it a popup will be open. But I'm not being able to complete the edit task.

One more thing you will have found in it is multiple reference.
